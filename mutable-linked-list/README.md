TODO:
- More features from Scala's [LinkedList documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.5/scala/collection/mutable/LinkedList.html) such as
  - forall
  - reduce
  - map
  - filter
  - reverse (should be pretty easy)
- Doxygen documentation
- Make unit tests for different cases (edge cases, common cases, etc.)
